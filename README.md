# End to End Data Analytics Project (Python + SQL)

## Introduction
This project is a comprehensive demonstration of building an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Python and SQL. The focus is on automating the data retrieval process, followed by data processing, cleaning, and finally loading the cleaned data into a SQL server for analysis. The project aims to provide a scalable solution for data analytics, showcasing the integration of various data engineering and analysis techniques.

## Project Architecture

The architecture of this project includes:

Data Extraction: Automated retrieval of the dataset from Kaggle using Kaggle API.
Data Processing and Cleaning: Utilized Python's Pandas library to process and clean the raw data, ensuring high data quality.
Data Loading: Loaded the cleaned data into a SQL Server for efficient querying and analysis.

## Technology Stack
Programming Languages: Python, SQL
Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy
Database: SQL Server
Tools: Kaggle API, Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, Git

## Dataset Used
Source: Kaggle Dataset

## Description: 
The dataset is automatically retrieved from Kaggle using the Kaggle API. It contains various features relevant to the analysis performed in the project.

## Project Steps
Data Extraction: Downloaded the dataset from Kaggle using the Kaggle API, automating the initial data retrieval process.
Data Processing and Cleaning: Applied data cleaning techniques using Pandas to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and format data for analysis.
Data Loading: Loaded the processed data into a SQL Server for further analysis and querying.
Data Analysis: Performed SQL-based analysis on the cleaned dataset to derive insights and support decision-making.

## Key Features
Automated Data Pipeline: A fully automated ETL pipeline that handles data extraction, processing, and loading.
Data Quality Management: Ensured data integrity and quality through systematic cleaning and transformation.
Scalable Architecture: Designed a scalable architecture capable of handling large datasets and complex queries in SQL Server.

## Results
The project successfully automated the data extraction, processing, and loading processes, resulting in a clean, ready-to-analyze dataset. The SQL-based analysis performed on the data provided actionable insights and demonstrated the effectiveness of the ETL pipeline.
